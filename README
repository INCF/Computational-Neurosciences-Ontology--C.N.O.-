CNO aims to be a domain specific ontology, describing Computational Neurosciences models. CNO was created to add semantic information to NineML, a simulator independent language developed by the INCF Multi-Scale modeling Program (http://software.incf.org/software/nineml).NineML aims to provide an unambiguous description of neuronal network models for efficient model sharing and reusability.The proposed ontology is currently an alpha version.This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.
